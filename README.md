# ML_AI_showcase

Projects are diced as some files were too big for github (full signal analysis project with frontend or just big csv or image files)

## airlines
Classification task to get binary result if we get delay or not.
## australia rainfall
Classification task to get binary result if we it will rain or not.
## algos and agents
Older projects
- reinforcement learning
- markov decision proccess
- implementation of knn algo and bayes algo
- a star
## natural images
Using tensorflow making cnn for image classification
## signal analysis
22 hours of medical signals with annotation of artefacts. Tested various aproaches before settling on knn classification. Aproach regarded as unique as it differes from classical aproaches (iso forrests, normal analysys (fourier), LSTM (all tried all failed))
Deployment of model for use.
